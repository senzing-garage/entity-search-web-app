  <p>Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
  <p>A sexy mistake. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. That's not soon enough!</p>
  <p>Soon enough. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. But I've never been to the moon! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?</p>
  <p>Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Bite my shiny metal ass. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</p>
  <p>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</p>
  <p>Look, last night was a mistake. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. No argument here. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
